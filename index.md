# About Me
I'm a 3rd year B.S. candidate in Computer Science at Stanford University.
During school I study the genetics of skin cancer in 
[Carolyn Lee's Lab](https://leelab.stanford.edu).I've spent the past two
summers researching precision medicine for Glioblastoma
in [Kristin Swanson's Lab](http://mathematicalneurooncology.org) at The Mayo Clinic.
After undergrad I plan to get an MD/PhD and become a physician-scientist.
Outside of science I like movies and trying new burger
restaurants.

# Research Interests
My interests focus on applying informatics to better understand disease biology, 
building tools to improve physician decision-making, and using evidence based
medicine to evaluate medical practices. I'm also an advocate for open science,
reproducible research, and science education. 

# Research Experience
## Lee Lab
My research at school focuses on using bioinformatics to characterize
novel genes and identify treatments for skin cancers. I have experience
conducting Whole Exome and RNA sequencing studies using
Stanford's [Sherlock](https://www.sherlock.stanford.edu/docs/overview/introduction/)
HPC cluster. My responsibilities also include managing data pipelines and storage
for the lab.
## Swanson Lab
My summer fellowships used MR imaging to study different aspects of Glioblastoma.
Freshman year I investigated sex differences in MR imaging. Sophomore year I studied 
blood brain barrier permeability in mice, building models to 
predict drug distribution in the brain. I also helped develop prognostic risk models
to predict survival using tumor size and location. Both summers required me to build
data pipelines to preprocess imaging data for analysis.
