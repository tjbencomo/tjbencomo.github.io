# About Me
I'm a 3rd year B.S. candidate in Computer Science at Stanford University.
During school I study the genetics of skin cancer in 
[Dr. Carolyn Lee's Lab](https://leelab.stanford.edu). I've spent the past two
summers researching precision medicine for glioblastoma
in [Dr. Kristin Swanson's Lab](http://mathematicalneurooncology.org) at The Mayo Clinic.
After undergrad I want to attend graduate school and study
how we can combine molecular and clinical data sources to improve patient outcomes.

# Research Interests
My interests focus on applying informatics to better understand disease biology, 
building tools to improve physician decision-making, and using evidence based
medicine to evaluate clinical practices. I'm also an advocate for open science,
reproducible research, and science education. 

# Research Experience
## Lee Lab
My research at school focuses on using bioinformatics to characterize
novel oncogenes and identify treatments for skin cancers via drug repurposing.
I have experience conducting Whole Exome and RNA sequencing studies using
Stanford's [Sherlock](https://www.sherlock.stanford.edu/docs/overview/introduction/)
HPC cluster. My responsibilities also include managing data storage and pipelines
for the lab.
## Swanson Lab
My summer fellowships used magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to study different aspects of glioblastoma.
Freshman year I investigated sex differences in MR imaging. Sophomore year I studied 
blood brain barrier permeability in mice, building models to 
predict drug distribution in the brain. I also helped develop prognostic risk models
using tumor size and location and I implemented neuroimaging 
pipelines to process MR images.
